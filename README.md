# Solar-Photovoltaic-Power-Optimization-using-Neural-Network

The goal of this project is to construct and train a neural network predicting solar PV panel power output from any data set of operating conditions (outside air temperature, solar radiation intensity, load resistance). Then, we developed and evaluated a machine-learning based model to determine which panels configuration (series/parallel) of a solar PV system would maximize the power output for a given set of input operating conditions.
